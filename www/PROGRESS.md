Task
----

- Been long time since i played with Vagrant last time (and never tried Phalcon, so this is going to be an interesting experience).
- Searched for vagrant config with phalcon and php7 pre-configured (https://gist.github.com/Lewiscowles1986/4928f7dd04c599b64ba041fd7334f9c3)
- Installed the box with no problems and pulled task interfaces in
- Initiated GIT repository (including vagrant files)
